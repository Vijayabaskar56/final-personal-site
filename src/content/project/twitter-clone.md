## Overview

Developed using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and PostgreSQL for the back end. This project replicates the core functionality of Twitter, allowing users to post tweets, follow others, and engage with a familiar social media experience.

## FrontEnd

Leveraged React and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Implemented features such as infinite scrolling, image uploading, and user profile customization to enhance the user experience.

## BackEnd

Utilized Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API that handles user authentication, tweet creation, and user interaction. Integrated PostgreSQL with SuperBase to store user data and tweets, ensuring data integrity and security.
