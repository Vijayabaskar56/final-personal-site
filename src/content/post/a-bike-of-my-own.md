I am not much of Bike guy, I don't have that much interest in bikes like others in my age. I only had fear and insecurity about bike in general.
cause, growing up in my house, there is no bike and I am not that social person who would ask other bike and learn from it. So whenever my friends take
about having, owning, riding a bike , I always feel insecure about that, cause I don't even know how to ride a bike, and Even when I had changes to learn and ride a bike, I have these fear what if I drop the bike and damage others bike.

That Changes from 24/01/2025, I have a bike of my own, and I know how to ride a bike, I no longer have to feel insecure or fear about bike. I still don't know much about bikes, but I will learn it in the flow.

Now About the thought that I have.

## Life is a Game and This Bike is a Power Up for me to move to the Next Level

This is the thought , that I have on my way when I going to get the delivery of the bike. I know it kind of silly thought, but there is a reason behind the thought.

I am always a average person, in studies , sports and most of everything, I never trying to anything more than that. I never thought about beating someone in something, winning something, becoming good at something. And this is the year I am finally trying to actually improve myself, in both physical mental and intellectual and skill wise.

The Way I think about time, money, knowledge everything is changing or it safe to say evolving every day. I see life as a game now and when I trying really hard at something and put in the time and mental effect it needed, I can do anything and learn anything, and in the game of life you get power up, life lines, and level up.

And this way of thinking about life is rewarding. so I am trying hard to improve ,myself and I see this bike a Power up that from the Universe for my efforts, that I am putting, and I if I continue to put in the effort and work. I know anything is possible and I can achieve all my goals , and time to time I get this power up form the universe or (my mind be like : it's not universe it your brother you idiot), and It's my responsibilities to use these power-up wisely wisely
