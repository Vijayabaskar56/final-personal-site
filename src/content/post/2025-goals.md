## Anti-vision. Your picture for the life you despise
   I don't wanted to be working in a company that not care about, doing job that I don't care about
   I don't wanted to be skinny forever as I am currently now ,
   I don't wanted to regrate about what my life at the death bed ,
   I don't wanted to in a place of getting help , financially!
   I don't wanted to convince myself , I am not lucky enough.

## Vision. Your picture for your ideal future.
   I wanted to be who is smart , intelligent and mature person
   I wanted to be a healthy person, a runner.
   I wanted to be a good person , not for every one around me , not for everyone who know me , or like me , I wanted to be a good person for my own self.
   I wanted to be a creator not a consumer , I wanted to be a explorer

## Constraints. What you aren't willing to sacrifice to reach your vision.
   My Family.
