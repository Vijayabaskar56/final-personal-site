literally I have no idea where to start this from. let see

I don’t have any specific Dreams too the extent I don’t even have any about Dreams. All I do was just live a lame, boring, regular, fucking life. It’s seem like all I do in my whole life is just watching tv, cartoon’s, then evolve into movies and series and now it’s anime’s. I kind a say thanks to that for myself. I have a get to experience lot of ideology's and moral through the things that I watched. But, why am I saying that now, it’s because that when I first got this ideas about Dreams and how important it is for a man and the true excitement when you get to chase those dreams until you achieve it. Especially anime, like one piece, Naruto and most of the anime.

so I ask myself these question after watching. What is my Dream ? I can’t answer NO, I don’t have answer.

## Find my Dream

So I don’t have the answer and don’t try anything to find the answer I don’t really search for it actually, But now I think, I can answer that question that I just found the answer, and the answer is not just come out of thin air, I comes from the some of youtuber, influencers, so what it then ?

Before tell about the answer I think I need to find how it’s come from. A man that I admire most in recent day’s which is Varun mayya he is a man who everything that I wanted to be he, I like the  every aspect of him, he is intelligent, he is a storyteller, he is a mentor, he is all the thing I wish for me to have. It’s seems like I priced him lot, but he is not the only one there are others too like ankur warriko, sath goal, and many more. But he is youngest of them all. ok enough about my Ideals, let end this, from these where I get my answer to my question.

## Answer..!

I want to become an become an ENTREPRENEUR.  or say like this “I AM THE MAN WHO IS GOING TO BE THE FOUND OF AN COMPANY” or “YOU WILL SEE, ONE DAY I WILL BECOME A ENTREPRENEUR SO GREATER THAN THE ALL PREVIOUS ONCE, AND THEN EVERYONE START DISRESPECTION ME AND TREAT ME LIKE SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY IMPORTANT” ok I go too far I think

> Entrepreneurship is **the creation or extraction of value**. The process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business/or procedures.
> 

that, what wiki says about the entrepreneur. 

## My Definition

But, I don’t care what wiki definition is, I just don’t care. For what I experience Entrepreneur is not just starting an company, or rise that company to that to next Facebook or Google. For me starting a company means a journey with lot of hardship and it’s really hard or impossible for some like me. it’s seems like I degrade myself but that the truth, I don’t stand a change if try to found a company, that the precise reason that I want to be an entrepreneur because what fun if it a dreams that is so simple to achieve. Dreams are meant to be unachievable, but the journey to try to achieve , try to do the impossible is where the really fun is, at least that’s what I think about dreams.  

## Plan

I really don’t have any plan or any idea how am I going to be become an entrepreneur and I don’t want to make any plan to how to achieve it too that’s because I never really succeeded in my any previous plan. Plan are destient to fail in my case, So I know that I can’t do it along I need a team to hold me when I fall , support me when I break, encourage me when I win, so here is the first thing to do find a team, then I can figure out something. This is my first step towards my dreams.

What it takes to become an entrepreneur, that it also I think I need to figure out something along the way 

## Let the Journey Begins....

It’s almost the end of my collage day’s, I written this almost a year ago and I still haven’t do a single thing that move me toward achieving this dream of mine, I think’s along this period I almost about my dream completely..

And I have made a decision not to continue my study here after, cause I kind of feel’s it’s pointless to waste my another 2 year’s of life in studying on some collage. Now, I am glad that I written this piece, which made me remember about my dream and my reason for that dream, but I still had no idea how am I going to achieve this dream of my.. but I had to try. 

I don’t want to plan anything this time also, but this time I am going to set a timeframe, and I am going to achieve this dream within next 6 Six. It’s a fare timeframe I thing and I am going to record that journey on this written piece along the way..

**Without a goal you can’t score…(6 years….!!!!!)**
