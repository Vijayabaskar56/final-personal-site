It's almost end of the year , just a few more day's to go, and I look at my 2024 goals, blog is no among them!

Did I follow my plan, achieve my goal this is year ? probably not , nah ,I this cycle is repeating itself through out my file , so why is that , in this blog post , I wanna reflect upon the reason for it.

There are two kind of People,

## The Thinker (and that properly me)
  
  I always dreams big and create plan and goals, then some time after I start to think different think and start
  to create plan for thats

  if I think about it now , this whole year, I have made think about count less project ideas and n number of plan to improve my health and for self improvement but I am ashamed to say that I have not even follow through a single one of the plan to the end , and not completed not even a single project fully.

  I always think and then Procrastinate, even worst tell every one about my goals , to every one of my friends (don't even need to be close one) about my plans and goals , and then fall flatter,

  And if I think about why am I tell them about my goals, I have not even trusting myself enough to follow through and achieve my goals, so buy tell other about my goals , I am try to impress them one , and another is I am trying to see if at least I will follow through my plan and achieve my goal cause I have told other , and that ultimately always not working.

  Reason the Movement I try to do something not for my who self just to impress other , it was destined to failed.

  and when I reflect on this I am realizing, I lack discipline and I am held back by procrastination and if I don't change it , I will remain in the same place each year , shucked , blaming the circumstance and fate

## The Doer (the One I need to become)

  The Doer is Some one Who keep their Plan Private , because they doing it work themselves not for others or validation

  They do What they Say and they do it right away, moving 100 x faster through life then everyone else

  Their day Complete with a sense of accouplement , cause they have actually do the Work, and exited to wake up next morning for what await

  and that how I wanted to be.

  so let start from this second, try to be a Doer , be a Doer , become a Doer!
